# Question-Answer-Data-Creater-Model
This model can be made by finetuning the **flan-t5-large model** from the **transformers library** on this tiny custom dataset to create **question-answer pairs** from some text.

# Function of Model
This model will takes some sentences of text and and generates some question-answers pairs from this text. Since, it was trained on a tiny dataset, the accuracy is questionable but nevertheless it is a working model.

# Applications
This model is fundamentally created for creating **flashcards** i.e. it was made for making question-answer pairs but it can also be used to generate some data from **web-scratched** uncleaned data.

# Resources

This repo contains the model creating code (in **huggingface transformers library style**) and the data used to train it. As I have said, it is a tiny dataset but it can be used for some tasks.

THIS REPO DOESN'T CONTAIN THE MODEL ITSELF DUE TO GITHUB LIMITATION.
