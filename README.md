# Question-Answer-Data-Creater-Model
This model is made by finetuning the flan-t5-large model from the transformers library on a tiny custom dataset to create question-answer pairs from some text.

# Function of Model
This model takes some sentences of text and and generates some question-answers pairs from this text. Since, it was trained on a tiny dataset, the accuracy is questionable but nevertheless it is a working model.

#Applications
This model was fundamentally created for creating flashcards i.e. it was made for making question-answer pairs but it can also be used to generate some data from web-scratched uncleaned data.

# Resources

This repo contains that model (in huggingface transformers library style) and the data used to train it. As I have said, it is a tiny dataset but it can be used for some tasks.
